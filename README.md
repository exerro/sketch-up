For reference, this has been put on hold until I can get a GLFW build in LWJGL that supports stylus input.

Last I checked, there's a PR for GLFW which adds the support, but it's not yet been merged, and is therefore not available easily through LWJGL.

Check out https://kleki.com/ in the meantime!
